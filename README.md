# user-validation-system
This project is part of the Python: Code2Xplore – 60 Days Challenge (Day-1) conducted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM University–AP. The objective of this challenge is to design a basic User Profile Validation System using Python. The program validates user details such as full name, email ID, mobile number, and age based on predefined rules. The implementation strictly uses basic Python data types, string operations, and conditional statements, without using advanced concepts, to ensure a strong foundation in Python programming.
